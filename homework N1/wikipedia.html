        <h1>Web development</h1>
        <b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a website for the <strong>Internet</strong> <i>(World
            Wide Web)</i> or an <strong>intranet</strong> <i>(a private network). <br /></i><sup>[1]</sup> Web
        development can range from developing <ins>a simple static page of plain
            text to complex web applications,<br> electronic businesses, and social network services</ins>. A more
        comprehensive list of tasks to which Web
        development commonly refers,<br> may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client
        liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and<br> network security configuration, and e-commerce
        development.
        <br><br>
        <em>Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
            sites: writing markup <br> and coding.<sup>[2]</sup> Web development may use content management systems
            (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</em>
        <br><br>
        For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
        developers) and follow <br> standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.<sup>[1]</sup>
        Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent <br> or contracting developer, or secondary assignment
        to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems <br> technician. Web development may
        be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department.<br> There are
        three kinds of Web developer specialization: <mark>front-end developer</mark>, <mark>back-end developer</mark>,
        and <mark>full-stack developer</mark>.<sup>[3]</sup> Front-end <br> developers are responsible for behavior and
        visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.<sup>[4]</sup> <br>
        <del>Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used
            technologies ever.</del>

        <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and web development</h2>
        <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>
        <p>
            <ins>Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN.</ins><sup>[5]</sup>
            <br><br>
            The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of
            academics affiliated with <br> institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, HTML was
            developed in 1993.<sup>[6]</sup>
            <br><br>
            Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount
            of information.<sup>[7]</sup> Core <br> protocols of web 1.0 were HTTP, HTML and URI.[8]
        </p>
        <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
        <p>
            Web 2.0, a term popularised by Dale Dougherty, then vice president of O'Reilly, during a 2004 conference
            with Media Live, marks a <br> shift in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity.<sup>[9][10]</sup>
            <br><br>
            Web 2.0 introduced increased user <strong> and communication.</strong> It evolved from the static, read-only
            nature of Web 1.0 and <br> became an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often
            referred to as a user-focused, read-write online network.<sup>[7]</sup>
            <br><br>
            In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a <mark><sub>platform</sub></mark> that
            encourages sharing activities such as creating <br>music, files, images, and movies.<sup>[11]</sup> The
            architecture of Web 2.0 is often considered the <i>"backbone of the internet,"</i> using <br>standardized
            <b>XML (Extensible Markup Language)</b> tags to authorize information flow from independent platforms and
            online databases.<sup>[7]</sup>
        </p>
        <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
        <p>
            Web 3.0, considered the <em>third</em> and <del>current version of the web, was introduced in 2014.</del>
            The concept envisions a complete redesign of <br> the web. Key features include the integration of metadata,
            precise information delivery, and improved user experiences based on <br> preferences, history, and
            interests.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
            <br><br>
            <mark> 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing more functionality than
                traditional search engines. </mark><br>Users can customize navigation based on their preferences, and
            the core ideas involve identifying data sources, <br>connecting them for efficiency, and creating user
            profiles.<sup>[7]</sup>
            <br><br>
            This version is sometimes also known as Semantic Web.<sup>[12]</sup>

        <h3>Evolution of web development technologies</h3>
        <p>
            The journey of web development technologies began with simple HTML pages in the early days of the
            internet.<br> Over time, advancements led to the incorporation of CSS for styling and JavaScript for
            interactivity. This evolution transformed <br>static websites into dynamic and responsive platforms, setting
            the stage for the complex and feature-rich web applications we have today.
